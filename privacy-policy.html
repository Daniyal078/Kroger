                            <p>A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your browser on your device. We use
                                cookies to deliver a better experience by, for example, remembering your preferences and

                            <p>Other examples of why we use cookies include:</p>

                            <p>In many cases, the data collected through these cookies is controlled by us, but in some
                                cases the data collected through use of these cookies is controlled by our vendors or
                                other third parties.</p>
                            <p>Cookies may remain on your device for an extended period. If you use your browser’s
                                method of blocking or removing cookies, some, but not all, types of cookies may be
                                deleted and/or blocked. If you delete or block cookies, some functionality on our

                            <p><strong><em>Other Tracking Technologies</em></strong></p>
                            <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other types of tracking technologies in connection
                                with our websites, mobile applications, advertisements, and other digital service
                                offerings.</p>
                            <p>Like with cookies, the data collected through these other types of tracking technologies
                                is in many cases controlled by us. However, in some cases the data collected through
                                these other technologies is controlled by our vendors or other third parties such as our
                                clients.</p>
                            <p>Examples of other tracking technologies include:</p>
                            <p><strong><em>-Web Beacons</em></strong></p>
                            <p>Web beacons are embedded images or objects that are used on web pages or emails. Examples
                                of why we may use web beacons include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For business analytics purposes, such as understanding the number of people who
                                    visit a webpage or view specific content within a webpage</li>
                                <li>To improve our websites and services</li>
                                <li>To detect and prevent fraud</li>
                                <li>To verify system and server integrity</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong><em>-Embedded Scripts</em></strong></p>
                            <p>We may use embedded scripts that collect information about your interactions with our
                                websites, mobile apps, and advertisements. These scripts are temporarily loaded into
                                your web browser and are active only while you are connected to our website, mobile app,
                                or advertisement.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>-Location-Identifying Technologies</em></strong></p>
                            <p>We may use GPS (Global Positioning Systems), beacons, or other location identifying
                                technologies to locate your device for various notified purposes, such as having your
                                order ready for pickup when you arrive at our store or to serve you timely
                                advertisements.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>-In-App Tracking Technologies</em></strong></p>
                            <p>Our mobile applications may use in-app tracking technologies including code from packages
                                referred to as software development kits<br>(SDKs). SDKs are packages of tools that help
                                our mobile apps function in some way.</p>
                            <p>For example, we may use code from SDKs in our mobile apps to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Develop our apps to work with certain operating systems or platforms</li>
                                <li> Provide you an in-app map</li>
                                <li> Personalize advertising</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Like with cookies, in many cases the data collected through these SDKs is controlled by
                                us, but in some cases the data collected through use<br>of these SDKS is controlled by
                                our vendors or other third parties.</p>
                            <p>Unlike cookies, SDKs and other in-app tracking technologies are not browser based and
                                therefore cannot be controlled through browser<br>settings.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>-Device and Activity Monitoring Technologies</em></strong></p>
                            <p>We may use technologies that monitor and record your experience and interactions with our
                                websites and mobile apps, such as the features you engage with, how you navigate our
                                websites and mobile apps, your keystrokes, cursor movements, scrolling activity, and
                                click-related activity. These technologies may also collect and analyze information from
                                your device, such as your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts.</p>
                            <p>Examples of why we may monitor your experiences and interactions include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To troubleshoot</li>
                                <li>To understand and improve our websites, mobile apps, and services</li>
                                <li>To customize your experience</li>
                                <li>To respond to your inquiries and requests</li>
                                <li>To detect and prevent fraud</li>
                                <li>To detect security incidents and other malicious activity</li>
                                <li>To verify system and server integrity</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong><em>Third-Party Interactive Features</em></strong></p>
                            <p>We may engage vendors to provide certain interactive features on our website. Your use of
                                these interactive features on our website is<br>voluntary, and we may retain the
                                information that you submit through these features. For example, we may offer an
                                interactive chat<br>feature on the website to assist you with your order and other
                                customer service purposes. When you participate in the interactive chat, the<br>contents
                                of the chat may be captured and kept as a transcript. By using these features, our
                                vendors may process the information obtained<br>through the feature to provide the
                                service on our behalf.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>Third-Party Analytics</em></strong></p>
                            <p>We may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or other analytics providers to obtain
                                analytics information about our websites and applications. These analytics providers may
                                use cookies and other tracking technologies that help us analyze how you use or interact
